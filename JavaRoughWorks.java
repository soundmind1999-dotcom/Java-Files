for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}





for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.





The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:

Example
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);




Example explained
Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts: int i = 0
Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run: i < 5. If the condition is true, the loop will run again; if it is false, the loop ends.
Statement 3 increases a value each time the code block has run: i++


Print Even Numbers
This example prints even values between 0 and 10:

Example
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

Sum of Numbers
This example calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5:

Example
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}
System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);

Countdown
This example prints a countdown from 5 to 1:

Example
for (int i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

For Loop With False Condition
Just like a while loop, a for loop may also never run. If the condition is false right from the start, the code inside the loop will be skipped entirely:

Example
for (int i = 10; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println("This will never be printed");
}
